# Advent of Code 2022

This isn't supposed to be how you like to write code, it's just how I _like_ to write code.

But hey, if you want to try it out, go for it.

Running a day

```sh
npm install    # Spin those fans
npm run day 03 # Run a day (actual directory name, so leading 0 is important)
```

Making a new day

```
node ./new-day.js
```
